        <h2>Waterpark info</h2>
        <p>Wet n Joy Lonavala, located in the lush Western Ghats, is a popular destination for Mumbai and Pune residents, and for good reason! With its 25+ international rides, including India’s largest wave pool at 60,000 square feet, there’s something for everyone at Wet n Joy.

          Thrill-seekers, get ready to experience the adrenaline rush of the Aqua Chute, Turbo Force, and Giant Frisbee rides! Families, rejoice! The Crazy River, Rain Dance Station, and Royal Castle aqua station are the perfect places to cool off and have some fun together. And of course, no waterpark visit is complete without a swim in India’s largest wave pool!
          
          When you’re ready for a break from the water, Wet n Joy also has four restaurants serving a variety of cuisines, as well as food stalls selling ice golas, roasted corn, popcorn, and other treats.
